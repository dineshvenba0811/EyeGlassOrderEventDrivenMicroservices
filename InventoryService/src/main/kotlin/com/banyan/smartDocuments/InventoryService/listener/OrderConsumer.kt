/**
 * Listener for order events from the Order Service.
 * This service listens to the "order-placed" topic and processes incoming order events.
 * When an order is placed, it checks the inventory and either confirms the order or requests stock from suppliers.
 * It uses the InventoryService to handle the business logic of processing orders.
 * The service is annotated with @Service to indicate that it is a Spring-managed component.
 * The KafkaListener annotation specifies the topic to listen to and the consumer group ID.
 * The consumeOrder method is triggered when a new message is received on the "order-placed" topic.
 * It logs the received event and calls the InventoryService to process the order.
